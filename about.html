                Our six Founders came together to form the first chapter at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania on May 1, 1848. Since then, the fraternity has grown to become a nationally-recognized fraternity boasting over 140 undergraduate chapters and colonies with 40 graduate chapters. As of writing, there have been over 201,000 brothers initiated with over 9,500 active undergraduate brothers and 131,000 living alumni.

                    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Phi Gamma Delta unites men in enduring friendships...</p>
                    <p><strong>Vision:</strong> To be an active, vital force of men who courageously live our values...</p>
                    <p><strong>Values:</strong> Friendship, Knowledge, Service, Morality, Excellence</p>

                <p>
                Each day, our brothers set out to better themselves not only in the classroom, but as young men beginning their professional careers. We find the value in a well-rounded lifestyle including professional work, studies, extra-curriculars, and social events.

            <br><strong>campus involvement</strong><br>
            <p style="max-width: 65%;">
                
                
                The chapter places a special emphasis on ensuring that our members are involved across campus in clubs, activities, and programs that not only assist brothers in developing themselves professionally for life after graduation but also enrich our university and community. As of Winter 2025, FIJI brothers are involved in a vast amount of different clubs, activities, and programs across campus.
