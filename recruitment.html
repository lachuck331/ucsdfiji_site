                <h2>Why Rush FIJI?</h2>
                <p style = "max-width: 60%;">
                    What sets FIJI apart from other fraternities on campus is the diversity of our membership. We have members from all over the United States, and we recruit from across the country in the spirit of a true national fraternity. We do not look for forty copies of the same man; instead, we have a wide range of backgrounds and personalities. Generally, our new member classes are of a limited size so that each member gets to know the others from his class on a true, personal level.</p>

                Young men interested in joining the fraternity typically do so in their freshman or sophomore years at UCSD, though older students have been allowed to join as transfer students or initiated members from other universities. The process begins by registering with the Inter-fraternity Council. There are two periods of recruitment during which FIJI gives "bids" to Potential New Members--Fall and Spring Rush. During these recruitment periods, rushees will be invited to events that allow them to interact with the active members and learn about our organization.
